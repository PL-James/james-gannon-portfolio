  bio: `I've spent 15 years at the intersection of healthcare, technology, and trust — not advising from the sidelines, but building the systems that the industry runs on. As VP of Product at the PharmaLedger Association, I lead the product strategy for open-source platforms used across the global pharmaceutical ecosystem. Before that, I ran quality, trust, and safety for the same organization.

I co-authored GAMP 5 — the definitive industry guide for computerized system validation in pharma. I co-founded Lyfegen, a healthtech startup tackling outcome-based pricing. I chaired the Board of Public Technical Identifiers at ICANN — the organization that keeps the Internet's naming system running. I've keynoted conferences from Orlando to Macclesfield on everything from blockchain validation to computer software assurance.

I don't just talk about digital trust in healthcare. I ship it.`,
